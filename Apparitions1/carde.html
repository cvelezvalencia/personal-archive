	<p id="placa1">When we moved to the big house we inherited from Aunt Eulalia we discovered it was haunted with a ghost that cried and complained everywhere. At first we were terrified but afterwards we were simply annoyed by its constant moans. We prayed to the Virgin of Zapopan, and thanks to her the moaning finally ceased and because of that we leave her this little plaque.</p>
