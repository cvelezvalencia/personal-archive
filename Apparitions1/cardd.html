	<p id="placa1">After they left mass the 7th of June of 1942, sisters Rosa and Carmen Ruiz were crossing the alley behind the market when they were assaulted by a man with a gun, to avoid getting killed they immediately summoned the Lady of San Juan de los Lagos. The man only took their purses, which had nothing in them except a few coins and their prayer books, and did not hurt them at all; they thank the virgin for her good work with this plaque.</p>
